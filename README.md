# linting-action
This is an example file that can be used for an easy linter.

This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Lint". The workflow triggers on push events to branches named "Actions" and pull requests made to those branches. It sets up a job to run on an Ubuntu environment, performs code linting using Black and flake8 tools, and utilizes a custom linting action. The workflow checks and potentially fixes issues related to code formatting and style violations based on the specified configuration.

The file uses a custom linting action from the wearerequired/lint-action repository. It performs linting checks and fixes automatically using Black and flake8
